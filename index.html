    <p><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>

    <p>For each of 30 questions, an AI prediction and its confidence in its prediction will be provided. How the confidence is presented will vary.</p>

    <p>The AI will predict whether you should hit Button A or Button B. You will not be told anything else about Button A or Button B.</p>
  
    <p>You will have two options: 1) go along with the AI prediction or 2) pass. Each option will offer different amounts of points.</p>
  
    <p>Your goal is to earn as many points as possible, which will translate into extra money earnings (up to $5).</p>
