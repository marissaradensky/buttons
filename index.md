# Instructions

For each of 30 questions, an AI prediction and its confidence in its prediction will be provided. How the confidence is presented will vary.

The AI will predict whether you should hit Button A or Button B. You will not be told anything else about Button A or Button B. 

You will have two options: 1) go along with the AI prediction or 2) pass. Each option will offer different amounts of points.

Your goal is to earn as many points as possible, which will translate into extra money earnings (up to $5).
